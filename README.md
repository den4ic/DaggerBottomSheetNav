# Passing Data Between Fragment and BottomSheetDialogFragment Using Dagger and Navigation Component

Data transfer between a Fragment and a BottomSheetDialogFragment can be effectively managed using Dagger and the Navigation Component, avoiding the use of data transfer through constructors or interfaces, as well as SharedViewModel and Hilt. This approach allows for a focus on dependency injection and state management through standard tools.
